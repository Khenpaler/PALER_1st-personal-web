                    Hi there! My name is Khen Harold P. Paler, and I am excited to share with you my journey of learning HTML and CSS. Recently, I have developed a keen interest in web development and design, and have taken it upon myself to learn the basics of these programming languages. Through self-teaching and experimentation, I am making progress in grasping the intricacies of HTML and CSS, and am constantly seeking to improve my skills. My goal is to become a proficient web developer, and I am determined to work hard and achieve this objective. I am thrilled to be on this learning journey, and I can't wait to see where it takes me!
